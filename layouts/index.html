    <p>
        Ed is a <a href="http://gohugo.io" target="_blank">Hugo</a> theme designed for textual
        editors based on <a href="http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/">minimal computing principles</a>, and
        focused on legibility, durability, ease and flexibility. Our underlying technology is easy to
        learn and teach, and can produce beautifully rendered scholarly or reading editions of texts meant
        to last. To start using Ed, please see <a href="{{ .Site.BaseURL }}/documentation/">our
        documentation</a> for installation instructions and more. To learn more about the ideas behind Ed
        and a list of current features see our <a href="{{ .Site.BaseURL }}/about/">about</a> section. To
        see Ed in action, we've provided some sample minimal editions for you below.
