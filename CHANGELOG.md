## [Unreleased](https://github.com/sergeyklay/gohugo-theme-ed/compare/v0.7.0...HEAD)

### Changed

- Updated the minimum required Hugo version for this theme to 0.114.0.
- Refactored the theme configuration in `exampleSite/config/_default/config.yaml`
  to use Hugo's module imports instead of the `theme` variable. The theme's
  repository path is now specified under the `imports` section in the `module`
  block. This change improves clarity and aligns with Hugo's recommended practices
  for managing theme dependencies.
- Replaced the deprecated `--verbose` flag with `--logLevel info` in the npm
  script for `server` in `package.json`. This change addresses a deprecation
  warning introduced in Hugo v0.114.0, ensuring compatibility with future versions
  of Hugo.
