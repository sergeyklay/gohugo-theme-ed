## Acknowledgments

As many open source projects, Ed is the work of community. The project starts with the open web, and everything in between leading to {{< link src="https://gohugo.io/" class="external" target="_blank" hreflang="en" rel="noopener noreferrer" >}}Hugo{{< /link >}} and the wonderful team who wrangled that Go in our favor. This theme is adopted and finalized with new functionality from {{< link src="https://jekyllrb.com/" class="external" target="_blank" hreflang="en" rel="noopener noreferrer" >}}Jekyll{{< /link >}} {{< link src="https://github.com/minicomp/ed" class="external" target="_blank" hreflang="en" rel="noopener noreferrer" >}}Ed{{< /link >}} theme by {{< link src="https://twitter.com/elotroalex" class="external" target="_blank" hreflang="en" rel="noopener noreferrer" >}}Alex Gil{{< /link >}}. The original Ed theme stylesheets are built on top of {{< link src="https://github.com/poole/lanyon" class="external" target="_blank" hreflang="en" rel="noopener noreferrer" >}}Lanyon{{< /link >}}, a Jekyll theme based on {{< link src="https://getpoole.com/" class="external" target="_blank" hreflang="en" rel="noopener noreferrer" >}}Poole{{< /link >}}, "the Jekyll butler," both created by {{< link src="https://github.com/mdo" class="external" target="_blank" hreflang="en" rel="noopener noreferrer" >}}Mark Otto{{< /link >}} and distributed with an MIT license. Thanks, Mark, for your helpful streamlining! Special hat tips to brother-in-markdown-arms, {{< link src="https://github.com/c-forster" class="external" target="_blank" hreflang="en" rel="noopener noreferrer" >}}Chris Forster{{< /link >}}, and the generous {{< link src="https://github.com/inukshuk/" class="external" target="_blank" hreflang="en" rel="noopener noreferrer" >}}Sylvester Keil{{< /link >}} for his work on Jekyll Scholar.


We are strongly indebted to the research work and conversations stemming out of our {{< link src="https://xpmethod.columbia.edu/" class="external" target="_blank" hreflang="en" rel="noopener noreferrer" >}}Columbia's Group for Experimental Methods in the Humanities{{< /link >}}—or as we like to call it: \#xpmethod; the wonderful international comradery of {{< link src="http://www.globaloutlookdh.org/" class="external" target="_blank" hreflang="en" rel="noopener noreferrer" >}}GO::DH{{< /link >}}; and of course, the support of our {{< link src="https://library.columbia.edu/" class="external" target="_blank" hreflang="en" rel="noopener noreferrer" >}}Columbia University Libraries{{< /link >}} and its cozy {{< link src="https://studio.cul.columbia.edu/" class="external" target="_blank" hreflang="en" rel="noopener noreferrer" >}}Studio@Butler{{< /link >}}.
